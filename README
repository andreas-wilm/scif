Compilation
===========

Make sure you have squid and ViennaRNA installed:

* squid: http://selab.janelia.org/software/squid/squid.tar.gz
* ViennaRNA package:  http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/

In theory just typing
$ make
should work

Depending on your vienna rna and squid installation directories you might
want to set LDFLAGS and CFLAGS. For example if you've installed all
your libraries to $HOME/local then try:

$ env CFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/include/ViennaRNA LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib/ make


NOTE
====

This code hasn't been changed substantially since 2006 and might not
work with newer versions of ViennaRNA
